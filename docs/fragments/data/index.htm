		<p>
			Luga Data is a data-centric library, designed to retrieve data from diverse sources,
			expose them using a unified API, and allow you to consume and display the data anywhere within your
			JavaScript and HTML code,
			leveraging databinding and HTML templating.

		<p>
			Developing Luga Data we keep a few clear goals in mind. We are not looking for another MV* framework,
			we only want to do few things, stay focused and try to do them well.
			Luga Data is not strongly opinionated, it does not impose or even suggest the way you should design your
			applications.
		</p>

		<p>
			We want our applications to be independent from the way data is serialized/formatted,
			data is equalized and consumed using the same API, no matter if itâ€™s JSON or XML.
			Being format agnostic is a top priority for us, and you can easily extend the library to support additional
			formats too.
		</p>

		<p>
			Above anything else, we believe that simple, common tasks, should become almost trivial.
			At the very same time, complex tasks should be possible, even if the required functionality is not available
			out of the box.

		<p>
			Many ideas you will find here were inspired by <a href="https://github.com/adobe/Spry#spry-data">Spry
			Data</a>.
			Instead of forking that project, we decided to start afresh, since we wanted to also leverage
			<a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>.
			While the code was written from scratch, <a href="#common/notifier">luga.Notifier</a> is heavily based
			on the original Spry codebase and the data sorting implementation is almost the same.
