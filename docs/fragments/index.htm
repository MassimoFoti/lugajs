		<p>
			Luga JS encompass a set of JavaScript libraries, designed to build form and data centric
			applications, specialized tools that do few things and try to do them well.

			atomic yet flexible.
		</p>

		<p>
			Until version 0.9.7 used to require jQuery in order to stay compatible with older browsers.
			At that point we realized it was time for a change, we gave up supporting IE9 and IE10 and managed to get rid of the dependency.
			Unfortunately this came at a cost, since the signature of various API changed in a way that is not fully backward compatible
		</p>

		<p>
			At the moment the documentation is still using Bootstrap and jQuery,
			but this is only for convenience, the codebase does not require any of these two
		</p>

		<div class="alert alert-info" role="info">
			<strong>Handlebars</strong><br>
			By default Luga Data regions require <a href="#data/region/getting-started">Handlebars</a>,
			but you can <a href="#data/extensibility/custom-region-type">customize the way regions are rendered</a>, without using Handlebars

			Luga JS contains a comprehensive set of <a href="../test/SpecRunner.htm">unit tests</a>, developed
			with <a href="https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine">Jasmine</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			The unit tests play a fundamental role in ensuring the code is robust and, at the very same time,
			provide plenty of useful information about the API
		</p>

		<p>
			Code coverage is usually around 100%. You can check the <a href="../test/coverage/lcov-report/src/index.html">coverage
