	<div class="panel-heading">About Luga JS</div>
	<div class="panel-body">

		<p>
			Luga JS encompass a set of JavaScript libraries, designed to build form and data centric
			applications, specialized tools that do few things and try to do them well.
			Luga JS is not intended and will never be a framework, we believe in keeping our tools simple,
			atomic yet flexible.
		</p>

		<p>
			Luga JS currently requires jQuery, this doesn't means we believe jQuery is the best JavaScript framework available.
			We just feel itâ€™s convenient to use it for things like DOM traversing and manipulation.
			Future versions will drop support for older browsers and most likely will not require jQuery anymore
		</p>

		<p>Right now the following production ready libraries are available:</p>
		<ul class="luga-docs-list">
			<li>
				<a href="#common/index" title="Shared API and utilities">Common</a>:
				a minimal set of shared API and utilities
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#data/index" title="Dataset and binding">Luga Data</a>:
				data, binding and dynamically generated HTML
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#validator/index" title="Client-side form validation">Validator</a>:
				client-side form validation
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Luga JS contains a comprehensive set of <a href="../test/SpecRunner.htm">unit tests</a>, developed
			with <a href="https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine">Jasmine</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			The unit tests play a fundamental role in ensuring the code is robust and, at the very same time,
			provide plenty of useful information about the API
		</p>

		<p>
			Code coverage is usually around 100%. You can check <a href="../test/coverage/lcov-report/src/index.html">coverage
			report</a> by yourself

		<p>
			Luga JS is designed to work in IE10+ and most recent versions of Chrome and FireFox
		</p>

		<p>
			The codebase is developed and tested alongside <a href="https://jquery.com/browser-support/">jQuery 3.x</a>.
			We occasionally test it alongside version 2.x to ensure it's fully forward compatible and it should work
			just fine on that version too
		</p>

		<p>
			If you use jQuery version 1.x instead, you might run without major issues in older browser versions,
			but please be aware we do not actively test or support this configuration
