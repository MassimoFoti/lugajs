## Luga JS

[Luga JS](http://lugajs.org/docs/index.htm) encompass a set of data-centric JavaScript libraries, specialized tools that do few things and try to do them well.
It is not intended and will never be a framework, we believe in keeping our tools small, focused and sharp.

Luga JS is designed to work in IE11+ and most recent versions of Chrome, FireFox and Safari

Right now the following production ready libraries are available:

- [Common](http://lugajs.org/docs/index.htm#common/index):
a minimal set of shared API and utilities
- [Data](http://lugajs.org/docs/index.htm#data/index):
retrieve data from diverse sources, expose them using a unified API, leverage databinding and HTML templating
- [Validator](http://lugajs.org/docs/index.htm#validator/index):
a library for client-side form validation

Other libraries are available as separated projects:
- [Luga Router](https://github.com/lugajs/luga-router):
a feature-rich JavaScript library for client-side routing. It's compact, focused and extensible

You can install using bower by running: bower install lugajs
