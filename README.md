## Luga JS

[Luga JS](http://lugajs.org/lugajs/docs/) encompass a set of data-centric JavaScript libraries, specialized tools that do few things and try to do them well.
It is not intended and will never be a framework, we believe in keeping our tools small, focused and sharp.

Luga JS is designed to work in IE11+ and most recent versions of Chrome, FireFox and Safari

Right now the following production ready libraries are available:

- Common:
a minimal set of shared API and utilities
- Data:
retrieve data from diverse sources, expose them using a unified API, leverage databinding and HTML templating
- Validator:
a library for client-side form validation

You can install using bower by running: bower install lugajs
