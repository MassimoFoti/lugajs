###About Luga JS

<a href="http://massimocorner.com/lugajs/docs/">Luga JS</a> encompass a set of data-centric JavaScript libraries, specialized tools that do few things and try to do them well.
It is not intended and will never be a framework, we believe in keeping our tools small, focused and sharp.
